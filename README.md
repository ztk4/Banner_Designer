Banner_Designer
===============

Design Tool for Banners in Minecraft
------------------------------------

This is a webpage designed to help dynamically design banners for in game use.
It allows for design without the hastle of picturing it all in your mind first (or the 
struggle of having to wash layers off with a cauldren)
This also gives the capability of shifting layers up and down, and for exporting your design in crafting format
and/or NBT format

Notes:  All banner images are generated using python (that I wrote) from alpha charts made by Mojang (c) for Minecraft
        Additionally, all GUI images and dye images are also made by Mojang (c) and were either taken from Minecraft
        assets or downloaded from the Minecraft Wiki
        Also, the font used is Minecraftia by Andrew Tyler (font@andrewtyler.net) and is a pixel for pixel copy of
        the font used in Minecraft. Download at http://www.dafont.com/minecraftia.font
		The font used in the footer is Caviar Dreams by Lauren Thompson. Download at http://www.dafont.com/caviar-dreams.font
        This page is not commercial and has no adds of any kind. I make no profit from traffic here, but I plan to put in
        a Google Analytics system just to see how many hits I get because I'm curious.

For Bugs or Hugs please see the following minecraft forum link. This is where I will be looking for bugs that need fixing
or suggestiong for future features to be implemented.

Thanks for using my web page :)
